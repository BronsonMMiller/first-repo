little bit about me ... as of right now I'm just barely getting back into coding. I used to love doing super newbie stuff, like text games, visual basic, mad libs, calculators etc. as well as newbie hacking when I was about 12-14 yrs old.

I've just realized that this will be the perfect thing for me to do on my free time instead of going back to college. I really enjoy it and It's amazing, if not a little overwhelming, to realise how much you can do with code now!

I'm focusing on Python right now and a little bit on Java, although the more I begin to learn the more I wonder if this will ever be possible and I'm considering just slinking away to web development for now. Scary. 

Yay
